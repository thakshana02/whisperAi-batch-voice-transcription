You make dark, this color very dark. And from dark, you go to white. And here, you make a light, drawing white, and you go to, you go from dark to light. When here is becoming dark, you have a white color, the dots from light, light from dark to light. But when this point here, they are not dark, they are not divine. They all have to be disappearing, those points that are disturbing. If you make a line, it's all that triangle. If you go, I don't know why they're between. You can have here, and, this is a white line. Very light, yes? Very strong, and then it's faded inside. Then you start here, with another color, which is very, very light, and faded there. And then from another direction, you start very stark, and faded locally. If you make this color, very, very strong, and slowly, slowly, it's almost fading here. And then I take a color very strong here. When you go up, it's fading in. Then you color from here, and it's fading there. And you can make, you do those things here. If you do those things, a little bit red, and when it goes down, it becomes very light. And here you take the light, very light. Then, you have to take a color in there, in between, another color, it become dark here, and light here. .
